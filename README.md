# What is this? 

It's a Rock, Paper, Scissors game I made while going through the 'Foundations' portion of [The Odin Project's full-stack web development curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). The [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) was meant to familiarize me with the fundamentals of DOM manipulation in JavaScript. I learned a few other things along the way, too.

A live demo of this code as it currently stands can be viewed [here](https://maryangaodin.github.io/rock_paper_scissors/).
